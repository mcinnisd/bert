    "# Part 2: Building a Transformer Encoder and BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "The BERT model is a pre-trained transformer network. Creating a small BERT model will take two big piecse (1) building the transformer itself and (2) writing the code that incorporates the tranformer into BERT and has it set up for training. We'll try to simplify building this by thinking of the different pieces as building blocks that we can put together. Remember, all neural networks are _functions_ and you can compose functions together to make a new function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the overall diagram for Transformers/BERT:\n",
    "![The diagram of the transformer newtork](https://devopedia.org/images/article/235/5113.1573652896.png)\n",
    "The trickiest part is the left where we need to deal with the scaled dot-product attention. You've already seen attention though in Homework 2, so some of this should be familiar. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll implement the following pieces to put it all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Embedding: BERT will learn word embeddings that are similar to word2vec's _but_ also incorporate the position of the embedding in the sequence\n",
    "2. Multi-headed Attention: The core part of the network that learns how much each token should pay attention to all other tokens\n",
    "3. A Feed-forward Layer: The layer that transformers the attention-combined representations\n",
    "4. The Transformer Encoder: The unified transformer network that combines attention with the feed-forward layer\n",
    "5. A BERT Classification Layer: The classificiation part of BERT\n",
    "6. A BERT Masked Language Modeling (MLM) Layer: The part of BERT that deals with MLM training\n",
    "7. The overall BERT model: The final BERT model architecture that supports both MLM and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to read the instructions for all steps in Part 2 before getting started to see how the pieces might fit together. To get everything working, you'll need all parts, which build on each other, so we recommend starting with the first and moving on from there."

    "## Part 2.1: Embedding Layer\n",
    "BERT's input embeddings are normally the sum of three embeddings:\n",
    "- Token Embeddings: The input token embeddings\n",
    "- Position Embeddings: The position of the token in the sequence\n",
    "- Token Type Embeddings: The segment (sentence) the token belongs to\n",
    "\n",
    "The second piece helps BERT learn to distinguish that the same token is in different positions. Remember the attention mechanism works independently of where each of the tokens are; without positional information added to the word embedding, the model can't distinguish between words in different orders!\n",
    "\n",
    "The third piece was designed for the Next Sentence Prediciton (NSP) task during pre-training. Here, two sentences are provided as input with the special `[SEP]` token between them. The NSP task is a classifiction task based on whether the two sentences did or did not actually follow each other. Just like in word2vec, we would sample random sentences as not-next. The hope for this pretraining task was that it would help BERT learn discourse coherence. However, some later works have shown NSP doesn't actually help that much and training time is probably better spent on doing more MLM, so some more advanced models dropped this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, in Homework 3, you only need to deal with token embeddings and positional embeddings, but do not need to deal with token-type embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When talking about embeddings, people (and these instructions) will talk about various things being embedded, e.g., words, tokens, wordpieces, subwords, etc. In practice, these are all based on whatever the tokenizer is producing, and BERT (and you) is agnostic to what is actually being embedded. When the instructions talk about \"token embeddings\" this are still just the output of the BERT WordPiece tokenizer."

    "In practice, a \"head\" is just a linear layer that maps the hidden size to the output size. This linear layer allows the model to adapt the token representations to a particular task, while keeping the core transformer model parameters the same across tasks. A model could have multiple heads for different tasks.  In our implementation, we'll have two heads, one for the masked language modeling task and a second for classification.\n",

    "The MLM head maps the contextualized token embedding to the vocabulary, so if we have some embedding $e_i$, we're learning a weight matrix $W_{mlm}$ of size $|e_i| \\times |V|$. In BERT pre-training, this weight matrix is said to be _tied_ to the input embeddings; in practice, that means we use the same weights from the `Embedding` (!), except this time the weights are used as a linear layer! (NOTE: This means you're not defining a separate linear layer). You might also see this called \"parameter sharing\" where the same parameters (i.e., weights) are used in different parts of the neural network. "

    "\n",
    "Once the dataset is ready, we can use the `DataLoader` class  to load the data from the `Dataset` class, much like you did for Homework 2.  Remember that the Dataset class has the __getitem__ method  that returns the input_ids and the labels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Like Homework 2, we'll want to train using a _batch_ of items. This is good for two reasons. First, batching helps us learn from multiple examples at the same time, so the gradient is a bit smoother. Batching provides a good trade-off between SGD (one item at a time) and full GD (all items at once). Second, and perhaps more importantly, batching allows us to maximize the throughput of our computing resources. Depending on the hardware, some matrix operations are the same speed for different sized matrices, so if we can get more examples used to trained per step, this reduces the overall number of steps. You may have seen this in Homework 2 where increasing the batch size dropped the training time, up to some point. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `DataLoader` will randomly sample $b$ items from `Dataset` where $b$ is the batch size and turn those into a single `Tensor` to pass as input to the model. To create the batch itself, the `collate` function will tell the `DataLoader` how to turn multiple items into a single `Tensor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have a major wrinkle here. When we train BERT for MLM over sequences, not all the sequences have the same length. A batch itself is represented as a `Tensor`. When all the instances in the batch have the same length, we can concatenate/stack them. For example, if we had 10 instances of sequences of length 5, we can create a tensor that is size (10, 5). However, if some of those sequences have different lengths, we no longer can create a Tensor with a single length dimension! What to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we'll need to write the `collate` function so that it makes all the sequences have the same length. Typically this is done by adding a special `[PAD]` token to the sequences so that they all have the same number of tokens. However, this extra token is meaningless!  If we don't recognize this, then our model will learn to predict `[PAD]` tokens (yikes!). Therefore, we also need to create an _attention mask_ that tells us which tokens to ignore in the input because they are padding. "

    "## Part 3.3: Train BERT for MLM!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our `Dataset` and `collate` function, it's time to train the pre-model the BERT model for MLM. Working on your laptop to start, try training for 1-2 epochs on the `med` dataset. There's no guarantee the model will learn anything useful, but we can do some experiments later in Part 4 to take a look. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core steps for training are the following:\n",
    "1. Define your model\n",
    "2. Set up `wandb` for tracking its progress (this will be useful for monitoring when running on Great Lakes)\n",
    "3. Define the optimizers, learning rate, etc.\n",
    "4. Define the core training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The code won't look too dissimilar from past pytorch training loops in Homeworks 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training times can vary, but on an M1 Mac and the default hyperparameters, one epoch takes ~50min on the large dataset with \"mps\" and 6 hours on \"cpu\". The model and training seem to fit at 12GB of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "For training, we recommend trying to run either the medium or large for a few epochs. If your CPU is slower, try medium just for one epoch to get a sense of what it's learned in Part 4.  For getting a sense of whether the model is working, we strongly recommend testing your CPU-trained model with the masked language modeling task in Task 4.4 to see whether it can correctly fill in common words. The most similar words aren't always a good indicator that it's working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you can't train too long on your own machine. Once you've gotten the model working (e.g., some preliminary analysis in Part 4 looks \"okay\" -- doesn't have to be great), it's time to convert this to a script and run it on Great Lakes in Part 3.5 (more details there). You'll use the advanced GPUs on the cluster to go through 5 epochs (or more) during training, which will give you a good enough model that you can use it for the rest of the homework in Parts 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### VERY OPTIONAL PARTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling _really_ adventurous, you can try to speed up your model by trying a few of the much fancier things in pytorch. In practice, you should not need these for the homework. However, they can be fun to explore even with a CPU, though they make the biggest impact if you have access to a GPU too\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try using [torch.compile](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html) to optimize the `nn.Module` code (this tries to pre-compile the computation graph)\n",
    "- Rather than train with 32-bit floating point, use [amp](https://pytorch.org/blog/what-every-user-should-know-about-mixed-precision-training-in-pytorch/) to do mixed-precision training (i.e., fewer bits and faster). If you want to test this on Great Lakes, the GPUs there support \"fp16\" which will greatly speed up training. At the moment, `amp` isn't supported on \"mps\" devices, though it might show up [soon](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/88415).\n",
    "- Implement an alternative training loop using [`accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) and try using mixed precision (fp8, fp16, bf16) training"

    "\n",
    "Once you have your model debugged and can verify that it works on a small dataset (manual exploration in Part 4 will help), it's time to train it on more data and for a longer time period. To do this, we'll use the Great Lakes cluster at U-M which will give you access to a GPU that will make training run ~10x faster; this means more epochs and more data in the same amount of time so you get a better model. The Homework PDF has documentation on how use Great Lakes if you haven't seen it. The course account is limited to 4 hours of wallclock time and 16GB of memory, which were tuned specific for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great Lakes supports interactive mode with Jupyter and running a script as a job. We **strongly** encourage the latter. To get a GPU, you'll need to submit a job to the cluster, which uses [SLURM for scheduling](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/slurm-user-guide/). If you attempt to queue for an interactive job, you will have no control over when it starts, so you may end up having your notebook run for 4 hours from 3am to 7am and then it ends, at which point you have to get back in the queue. If you submit a job as a script (i.e., a .py file that runs the code in this notebook), it will run for the specified amount of time and save the BERT model without you having to interact with anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "SLURM and cluster scheduling is very common in some industries where there is a single cluster resource and people share it by submitting jobs to run so that no one can monopolize the system and that jobs can run in parallel. Given that Great Lakes will be useful to you in future assignments and projects, we strongly encourage you to learn how to use it effectively in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how you're working on this file, there's a few ways to directly convert the notebook to a file if you use [Jupyter or the command line](https://mljar.com/blog/convert-jupyter-notebook-python/) or [VSCode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64297272/best-way-to-convert-ipynb-to-py-in-vscode). Once you convert it, you'll modify the file some to change the epochs and text file as specified in the PDF. **We also strongly recommend having your script save the model at the end of every epoch.**  That way, if your script takes longer than 4 hours and gets killed, you still have the best saved model you could get based on the amount of training you could do."
